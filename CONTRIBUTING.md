# Contributing to alfa-leetcode-api

I'm excited you're interested in contributing to **alfa-leetcode-api**, a custom solution born out of the need for a well-documented and detailed LeetCode API. This project is designed to provide developers with endpoints that offer insights into a user's profile, badges, solved questions, contest details, contest history, submissions, and also daily questions, selected problem, list of problems.

## Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please check the Issues to see if it has already been reported. If not, open a new issue with a clear `title` and `description`. Include as much detail as possible to help us reproduce the issue:

- A clear and concise description of the bug.
- Steps to reproduce the behavior.
- Expected behavior.
- Screenshots or a video if applicable.


## Suggesting Enhancements

All ideas for new features or improvements are welcome. If you have a suggestion, please create a new topic on the [discussions page](https://github.com/alfaarghya/alfa-leetcode-api/discussions). Describe your idea and why you think it would be a good addition to the project.

### Working on Issues

First requirement: use the program. I've seen people wanting to contribute without using it.

Issues will only be assigned to users when enough discussion about their implementation has taken place. It's important that nobody keeps an issue assigned without making progress, as this prevents others from contributing. So, if you want to write code for an existing issue, start by discussing the issue and your proposed solution first.

I do think it's fine if you submit a PR for a bugfix you made without prior discussion, as long as you take the time to explain the **why** and the **how**. In that case, the issue won't be assigned to you until the merge is complete.

### Generative AI use

I don't want to go as far as prohibiting anyone from using AI. After all, at this point, _some AI use_ is inevitable. However, **purely vibe-coded PRs are not going to be approved**.

If you're using AI to generate code, you must make it very clear. And you'll have to own it and maintain it. I will review and ask as many questions as necessary about the code, and I reserve the right to judge whether I think the contribution is worth it or not.

Also, not properly communicating that you're using generated code in your PR is considered dishonest. If I find out, I'll have to close the PR.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`. Call it `feature/xyz-feature` or `bug/xyz-bug`.
